# How to find diskspace used of objects with Oracle

```sql
select owner, segment_name,sum(bytes/1024/1024) from dba_segments
group by owner, segment_name
order by sum(bytes/1024/1024) desc
```

If you only need the diskspace by owner :

```sql
select owner,sum(bytes/1024/1024) from dba_segments
group by owner
order by sum(bytes/1024/1024) desc
```
